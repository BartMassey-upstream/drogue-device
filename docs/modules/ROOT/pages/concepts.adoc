= Actors

An _actor system_ is a framework that allows for isolating state within narrow contexts, making it easier to reason about system. Within a actor system, the primary component is an _Actor_, which represents the boundary of state usage. Each actor has exclusive access to its own state and only communicates with other actors through message-passing.

=== Async

Each actor is single-threaded, able to process a single message at a time, allowing for lock-free processing of each event. As embedded processors are globally single-threaded, supporting multiple actors requires the usage of `async` and `.await` within the Rust ecosystem. Each actor can therefore process each message either synchronously if its logic is _non-blocking_ or using an `async` block if complex processing is required.

Each event is fully processed, in the order in which it is received, before the next event is considered.

While processing an event, an actor may send a message to another actor, which itself is an asynchronous action, allowing the system to continue to make progress with actors that are able to.

=== Messages

All messages are sent using async channels attached to each actor. The channel depth is configurable based on const generics. Upon starting, the actor
is given a handle to an `Inbox` from which it can await messages to arrive.

=== Addresses

Each actor within the system has its own unique `Address` which is used to communicate with the actor (through it's FIFO). 
There is an _async_ `request(msg)` method on each address to send a message asynchronously to the actor, which may only be used from another `async` context, as the sender must `.await` the response. There is also a _sync_ `notify(msg)` method on each address to send a message without awaiting a response.

Specifically, the `Address` for a given actor may implement user provided traits to provide fluent APIs for communicating with the underlying actor. For instance, the `Socket` type wraps an `Address` for actors that implement the `TcpSocket` trait.

=== Lifecycle

Each actor is wrapped in an `ActorContext` object which is stored as a `static` (global). When the application starts, each context is `mount(...)`ed, and provided an instance of the actor to "run".

During mount, the actor system will initialize the channels, and spawn the underlying `embassy` task. Once spawned, the actors `Address<...>` is made available.

=== Bootstrap

As with any embassy application, the entry point is specified using an async function marked with `#[embassy::main]`, and it will be passed a `Spawner` that is passed to each actor context `mount(...)`.

=== Packages

In some cases, it may be desirable to have two or more actors involve in a single semantic component or package. The `Package` trait may be implemented for any type.
