= drogue-device examples

The examples are grouped by chip family, then board, then variant. I.e.

For instance, the example in `nrf52/microbit/esp8266` is for the `nRF52` chip family, using the `microbit` board,
with a variant that uses a `esp8266` WiFi module.

All example can be run using `cargo run`, which in some cases require the `probe-run` tool (`cargo
install probe-run`) to flash the program.
