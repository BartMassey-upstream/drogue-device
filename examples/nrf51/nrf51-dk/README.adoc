== nrf51-dk drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the nRF51 development kit.

The example application configures a led, blinker and timer component that blinks
the led.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* Nordic nRF51 Development Kit

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have
https://rustup.rs/[Rust],
https://crates.io/crates/cargo-embed[cargo-embed] installed. In pratice
you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide
will assume cargo-embed is used.

=== Building

Make sure you have the correct target architecture supported in rust:

....
rustup target add thumbv6-none-eabi
....

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Flashing

Flashing the firmware uses the configuration from the Embed.toml file,
which auto-detects the probe connected to your device. If youâ€™re
experiencing problems, try setting the `usb_vid` and `usb_pid` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

The following command will build and flash the firmware and open the
debugger console so you can see the console debug output.

....
cargo embed --release
....
