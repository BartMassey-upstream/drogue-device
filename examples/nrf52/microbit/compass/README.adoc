== microbit-compass drogue-device example

This example application runs out of the box on the BBC micro:bit v2.0. It uses the builtin magnetometer, accellerometer and LED matrix as a compass, where the LED matrix arrow points the direction.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* BBC micro:bit v2.0

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have
link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup]. In practice
you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide
will assume that `probe-run` is used (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Building

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Running

Flashing the firmware uses `probe-run` which auto-detects the probe connected to your device. 
The following command will build and flash the firmware and open the
debugger console so you can see the console debug output.

....
cargo run --release
....

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once running, calibrate the sensor by filling lighting up all the LEDs.
