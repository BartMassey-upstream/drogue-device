== microbit-jukebox drogue-device example

This application runs out of the box on the BBC micro:bit v2.0. It uses the builtin speaker  and LED
matrix to play a tune and flash the LEDs together with the music.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* BBC micro:bit v2.0

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup]. In practice you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide will assume that `probe-run` is used (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Building

To build the firmware:

....
cargo build --release
....

=== Running

Flashing the firmware uses `probe-run` which auto-detects the probe connected to your device. 
The following command will build and flash the firmware and open the
debugger console so you can see the console debug output.

....
cargo run --release
....

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once running, "Smoke on the Water" should start playing.
