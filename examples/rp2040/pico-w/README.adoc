== Raspberry Pi Pico W example

This example application runs out of the box on the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

It uses the on board WiFi peripheral to send data to Drogue Cloud.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* link:https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/[Raspberry Pi Pico W]
* (Optional) A SWD debug probe

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[rustup].
* To flash the example using a debug probe, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).
* To flash the example using the UF2 bootloader on the pico, you can use the link:https://github.com/JoNil/elf2uf2-rs[elf2uf2] utility to convert the elf file into a .uf2 file that you can copy to the pico USB drive.
* A Drogue Cloud instance. See link:https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-cloud/[drogue-cloud] for how to run that, or use the link:https://sandbox.drogue.cloud/[sandbox] (requires TLS).


=== Configuring

Credentials for your local WiFi network will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
wifi-ssid = "..."
wifi-password = "..."
....

HTTP authentication will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
username = "..."
password = "..."
....

For Drogue Cloud, the username/password is stored in this form: `device_id@application`.

The example `config.toml` file for connecting to public Drogue cloud sandbox application could look like this:

```toml
hostname = "http.sandbox.drogue.cloud" # Replace with your own Drogue Cloud instance if you are not using the sandbox
port = "443"
wifi-ssid = "..."                      # The WiFi network SSID
wifi-password = "..."                  # The WiFi network pre-shared key
username = "device1@wifi-workshop"
password = "mysecretpassword"
```

== Running with debug probe

.Procedure

. Download the WiFi firmware from link:https://github.com/embassy-rs/cyw43/tree/master/firmware[], and flash them with probe-rs-cli:
+
----
probe-rs-cli download 43439A0.bin --format bin --chip RP2040 --base-address 0x10100000
probe-rs-cli download 43439A0.clm_blob --format bin --chip RP2040 --base-address 0x10140000
----

. Connect your debug probe and run:
+
----
cargo run --release
----
+
Once flashed, the device will attempt to join the WiFi network and send telemetry data to Drogue Cloud every 30 seconds.

== Running with UF2 image

.Procedure

. Download the WiFi firmware from link:https://github.com/embassy-rs/cyw43/tree/master/firmware[], and modify main.rs to include it:
+
----
// let fw = unsafe { core::slice::from_raw_parts(0x10100000 as *const u8, 224190) };
// let clm = unsafe { core::slice::from_raw_parts(0x10140000 as *const u8, 4752) };
let fw = include_bytes!("../firmware/43439A0.bin");
let clm = include_bytes!("../firmware/43439A0_clm.bin");
----

. Build the firmware
+
----
cargo build --release
----

. Convert the ELF output to UF2
+
----
elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/rp2040-pico-w rp2040-pico-w.uf2
----

. Hold the Pico W button while powering up the board, and copy the uf2 file to the USB partition
+
----
cp rp2040-pico-w.uf2 /mount/point/of/usb/drive
----
+
Once flashed, the device will attempt to join the WiFi network and send telemetry data to Drogue Cloud every 30 seconds.

. You can monitor the logs using a terminal emulator on the Pico W TTY
+
----
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
----

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
<ENV> cargo run <ARGS> -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....
