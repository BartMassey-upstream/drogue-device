== nucleo-h743zi-epd drogue-device example

This example application runs on the STM32 Nucleo H743ZI development kit attached to a
WaveShare 5.6inch 7-color e-Paper Display.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* STM32 Nucleo H743ZI development kit.
* WaveShare 5.6inch 7-color e-Paper Display.
* A finger or other stick-like device to push a button.

==== Software

* To build the example, you need to have link:https://rustup.rs/[Rust Nightly].
* To flash the example on the device, you need `probe-run` installed (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Configuring

Make sure you have the correct target architecture supported in rust:

....
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
....

==== Running

To run the firmware:

....
cargo +nightly run --release
....

== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is powered).

....
cargo +nightly run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....

Once flashed, the device will reset and look no different at first. 
Upon pressing the blue user button, the display will show Rodney and some text.
The text will update upon each button push.
