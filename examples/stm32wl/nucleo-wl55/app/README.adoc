== STM32 Nucleo-WL55 example

This example application runs out of the box on the STM32 Nucleo-WL55 Kit (NUCLEO-WL55JC2) doing
firmware updates OTA.

=== Prerequisites

==== Hardware

* link:https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-wl55jc.html[STM32 NUCLEO-WL55JC2]

==== Software

To build and flash the example, you need to have https://rustup.rs/[rustup]. In practice you can use whatever tool you want to flash the device, but this guide will assume that `probe-run` is used (`cargo install probe-run`).

=== Configuring

_Over The Air Authentication_ (OTAA) credentials will come from these entries in `~/.drogue/config.toml`:

....
"dev-eui" = "..."
"app-eui" = "..."
"app-key" = "..."
....



=== Running

First, flash the bootloader:

....
cargo flash --manifest-path ../boot/Cargo.toml --release --no-default-features --chip STM32WLE5JCIx
....

You can then run the application with the `dfu` parameter:

....
DEFMT_LOG=info cargo run --release
....

=== Usage

Once the device is flashed, it will connect to the local LoRaWAN network. Once the network is joined, you can press the B1 button on the development kit to send a test message `ping:<num-clicks>`, where `num-clicks` is the number of times you pressed the button since resetting the board.

==== LEDs

The board features 3 user controllable LEDs. The program will use 3 of them to show the internal status:

Blue:: Will light up when starting and turn off once it joined the LoRa network.
Green:: Turns on while sending the uplink message.
Red:: Turns on when receiving a downlink message and waiting for next uplink message.


=== Troubleshooting

If youâ€™re experiencing problems, try setting the `VID:PID` values to
that of your probe (you can find that from lsusb once your board is
powered).

....
cargo run --release -- --probe <VID>:<PID>
....
