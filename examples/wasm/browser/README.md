# Drogue-device WASM example

This example demonstrates running drogue-device in the browser.

It uses the Button and Led actors from drogue-device, which interacts with underlying HTML elements.

## Running

The simplest way to try this example is to install [`trunk`](https://trunkrs.dev/), and run the following
command:

```
trunk serve
```

This will spin up an HTTP server locally where you should see a button and the led state changing
whenever you click the button.
